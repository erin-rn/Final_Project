This Project uses the ag_map_with_alpha_data containing human microbiome samples and alpha diversity metrics. 
The aim of this project was to see if sample participants responses about whether they live with a cat, a dog, or the number of types of plants in their home has a significant influence on the alpha diversity of their gut microbiome. 
The software used is R. 
The output consists of an analysis of data normality, data visualizations, 2-way ANOVA, Tukey, and T-test analysis.
